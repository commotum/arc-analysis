## Keywords in the OEBP

Here are some properties of Bongard Problems that we have decided are interesting enough to distinguish with an easy-to-search label.  
To see all the Bongard Problems with (for example) keyword `nice`, type `keyword:nice` into the search bar.

Since this is a website based on showing properties of things in Bongard Problems, each keyword is actually a [meta Bongard Problem](https://oebp.org/BP537) (a Bongard Problem sorting Bongard Problems). To add a keyword to a Bongard Problem, add the Bongard Problem to the appropriate side of the Bongard Problem for that keyword.  
There is also a "KEYWORDS" section in the Bongard Problem submission form, in which you can enter the names of keywords, that makes this process more convenient.
