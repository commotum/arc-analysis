<h2>Goals of <a href="index.php">The On-Line
Encyclopedia of Bongard Problems</a> (or OEBP)</h2>
</div>

<center>

<div style="width:700px;text-align: left;">

This website ought to be free of jargon and easily browsable as possible. Right now, we are far from these goals.
<br>
<br>
Here are some guiding principles with which we would like to shape the future of the OEBP. Try to keep these in mind when writing new material.
<ul>
<li>
Keep <a href = "/glossary.php">jargon</a> to a minimum.
<ul>
<li>
There are certain pieces of jargon that are very frequently useful, like "<a href = "/keywords.php">BP</a>" and "<a href = "/world.php">world</a>". But even in these cases, prefer writing out "Bongard Problem" or "relevant examples".
</li>
<li>
If you do bring up one of our jargon words, like "<a href = "/BP513">narrow</a>" (a rule is "narrow" if people can figure out what it is just by seeing a lot of examples that satisfy it, without being given any counter-examples), not only should you link to a definition of it, but ideally you should also give a brief paraphrased explanation of what it means.
</li>
<li>
Names of <a href = "/keywords.php">keywords</a> should be in simple English, describing what they mean. A descriptive but long keyword is preferred over a snappy but unintelligible keyword.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Bongard Problem pages (other than <a href="/BP570">certain</a> <a href="BP868">weird</a> <a href="/search.php?q=keyword%3Aexperimental">experimental</a> ones) should include enough examples for somebody clever to figure out what the solution is meant to be, without peeking.
<ul>
<li>
Many of the Bongard Problem pages in our database (especially the <a href="/search.php?q=keyword%3Akeyword">meta Bongard Problems for keywords</a>) have only been filled in with examples on one side. We still need to get around to filling in those empty sides.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Bongard Problems should be tagged with appropriate <a href = "/keywords.php">keywords</a>, relevant <a href = "/concepts.php">concepts</a>, and <a href = "/world.php">world</a> (the world is the type of examples sorted by the Bongard Problem). Much of this information has not been filled in because this is tedious work. We ought to implement features that make labelling Bongard Problems with the relevant data more convenient.
<ul>
<li>
Also, Bongard Problems about esoteric (usually mathematical) topics should include links to resources relevant to whatever they are about.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Other planned features:
<ul>
<li>
    Better search.
</li>
<li>
    Easier-to-use submission page.
</li>
<li>
    Ability to select and arrange any examples from existing pages into a new Bongard Problem and download the image of that new Bongard Problem, which can then be used as an example in other Bongard Problems.
</li>
<li>
    Various additions to the <a href="solve.php">Solve</a> page.
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty adjustment.</li>
        <li>Ability to check whether you have got the correct solution by sorting extra boxes.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    Ability to set up links between Bongard Problems so that any example added to a certain side of a specific Bongard Problem will be automatically added to a certain side of another specific Bongard Problem.
</li>
<li>
    Option to browse the OEBP as a tree-like structure of all the <a href="/world.php">worlds</a> on the OEBP, showing which worlds are sub-worlds of others.
</li>
<li>
    Ability to look at multiple overlapping BPs at a time in a Venn diagram format.
</li>
<li>
    Support for algorithms that generate and sort examples for Bongard Problems.
</li>
<li>
    Support for more file types.
</li>
<li>
    Page history based on small changes to pages rather than storing whole sections of pages. (Currently whenever a user makes a small edit to the comments of a Problem, the entire comments section will be redundantly stored again in history.)
</li>
</ul>
