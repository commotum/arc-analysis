## Invalid Bongard Problems

The only strict rule for Bongard Problems is that the **exact same image can’t appear on both sides**.

![No solution](https://oebp.org/files/bad.png)

**No solution!**

---

However, here are some Bongard Problems that violate the *spirit* of Bongard Problems for other reasons.

---

### Dependence on Box Position

BP solutions should **not depend on the positioning of the boxes**. Rearranging the boxes on either side of a given BP should retain the solution.

![Invalid: position-based](https://oebp.org/files/shoc.png)

**Non-solution:**  
Box shown in diagram matches where box is vs. box shown in diagram doesn't match where box is.

---

### Properties of the Collection, Not the Boxes

BP solutions should **not be properties of the collection of boxes** that cannot be seen in individual boxes.

![Invalid: collection variance](https://oebp.org/files/images/image64.png)

**Non-solution:**  
High variance in position between boxes vs. low variance in position between boxes.

---

### Interpretation Depends on Other Boxes

Interpretation of a box should **not depend on any other box**. Each BP box should be unambiguously and correctly sortable even if all other boxes were absent.

![Invalid: relative size](https://oebp.org/files/chi.png)

**Non-solution:**  
Larger version of shape vs. smaller version of shape.

---

### Culture-Specific Solutions

BP solutions should generally **not reference anything specific to a certain culture**.  
For example, this BP is described by its own right side:

![Invalid: words](https://oebp.org/files/word.png)

**Non-solution:**  
English words with positive connotation vs. English words with negative connotation.

---

### Self-Referential Solutions

A BP's solution should **not be self-referential**.

![Invalid: self-reference](https://oebp.org/files/sr.png)

**Non-solution:**  
Box that is in this Bongard Problem vs. box that isn't in this Bongard Problem.

---

### Overly Convoluted Solutions

BP solutions should be **simple**. In particular, they should not involve long  
“… or … or … or …” chains.  
Any collection of random boxes (without repeats) admits some such convoluted solution.

![Invalid: random OR-chain](https://oebp.org/files/ran.png)

**Non-solution:**  
White triangle or large white circle or black shape with concavity on the down-left side or heptagon or partial sector of circle or hexagon vs. not that.
