## Terms

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **BP** | **Bongard Problem.**<br>A vertical dividing line with a collection of objects on either side.<br>Furthermore, there must be some simple description for each side that describes no object on the opposite side. See the [Welcome page](https://oebp.org/welcome.php) for more information. |
| **example** | An object belonging to one of the two sides in a **Bongard Problem**. |
| **box**<br>*or*<br>**panel** | A picture inside a square outline.<br>Traditionally, each **example** in a **Bongard Problem** is displayed in a box to visually separate it from the other examples. |
| **rule**<br>*or*<br>**pattern** | Some property in common among a collection of objects. |
| **solution**<br>*or*<br>**answer** | A **rule** that all **examples** on one side of a **Bongard Problem** fit but none on the other side do. |
| **MBP** | **[Meta Bongard Problem](https://oebp.org/search.php?q=keyword%3Ameta)**.<br>A **Bongard Problem** whose **examples** are Bongard Problems. |
| **MMBP** | **[Meta Meta Bongard Problem](https://oebp.org/search.php?q=keyword%3Ametameta)**.<br>A **Bongard Problem** whose **examples** are **meta Bongard Problems**. |
| **keyword** | An organizational tag used to categorize **Bongard Problems** on the OEBP. Keywords make it easy to search for all Bongard Problems of a certain kind. See the [Keywords page](https://oebp.org/keywords.php) for a complete list. |
| **world** | The type of thing a **Bongard Problem** sorts.<br>This is the most obvious **rule** all **examples** from both sides obey. See the [Worlds page](https://oebp.org/world.php) for more information. |
| **ambiguity** | An object is called *ambiguous* as a potential **example** for a **Bongard Problem** if it wouldn't clearly be sorted on the left or the right. See the [Ambiguity page](https://oebp.org/ambiguity.php) for more information. |
| **narrow** | A **rule** is *narrow* if people can figure out what it is just by seeing a lot of examples that satisfy it, without being given any counter-examples.<br><br>“Shaped like a five-pointed star” is a narrow rule. When you see a collection of five-pointed stars, it is obvious that is the pattern.<br><br>“Not shaped like a five-pointed star” is *not* narrow. When you see a collection of shapes that are not five-pointed stars, the absence of five-pointed stars will not jump out at you; you will just see the pattern as “shapes”.<br><br>To indicate that a side of a **Bongard Problem** is narrow, use the keyword [left-narrow](https://oebp.org/search.php?q=keyword%3Aleft-narrow) or [right-narrow](https://oebp.org/search.php?q=keyword%3Aright-narrow). (It is possible for both to apply.) |
| **wide** | A **rule** is *wide* when it is not **narrow** and its negation *is* narrow.<br><br>“Not shaped like a five-pointed star” is a wide rule.<br><br>Narrow rules seem intuitively “positive” and wide rules seem intuitively “negative”.<br><br>If one side of a **Bongard Problem** is narrow and the other side is wide, the OEBP loosely prefers to put the narrow side on the left (e.g., “stars vs. not stars” rather than “not stars vs. stars”). |
